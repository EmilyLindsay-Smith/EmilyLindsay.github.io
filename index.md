## About Me
Hi, I'm Emily. I'm a DPhil Student in Linguistics at the University of Oxford, with a particular interest in phonology, psycholinguistics, and Arabic linguistics.

I work at the [Language and Brain Lab](http://brainlab.clp.ox.ac.uk/), part of the [Faculty of Linguistics, Philology and Phonetics](https://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/), and am affiliated with [St Catz college](https://www.stcatz.ox.ac.uk/).

I have a long-standing fascination with languages, and varying levels of proficiency in Arabic, Turkish, Russian, French, Latin, and Ancient Greek. My BA in [Oriental Studies](https://www.orinst.ox.ac.uk/article/our-courses) (Arabic with Turkish) from [Pembroke College](http://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk) has led naturally into linguistic study of Arabic.

## Outside of Linguistics

I enjoy cooking, reading sci-fi and fantasy, and improving my programming skills.
