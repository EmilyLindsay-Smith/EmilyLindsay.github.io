# Research Interests

I'm interested in phonology, morphology, psycholinguistics, and Arabic linguistics. Therefore I'm fascinated by questions including:

- how are words processed by the brain?
- how are words produced by the brain?
- what is the internal structure of words?
- how do words change over time?
